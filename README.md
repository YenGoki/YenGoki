- Hi, I’m @YenGoki
- I’m interested in game development
- I’m currently learning pixel art and programming, I also want to speak and understand English and be fluent in the future.
- I’m looking to collaborate with "good" people, "it would be more like nice people", I'm at the beginning of everything so don't get your hopes up at least for now, I'll get to it soon!
